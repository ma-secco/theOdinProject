# Rock Paper Scissors

This is a simple Rock Paper Scissors game implemented as part of the curriculum on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). The goal of this project is to practice fundamental programming concepts such as conditional statements, loops, and functions.

## Game Rules

Rock Paper Scissors is a classic hand game typically played between two people. The rules are straightforward:

1. Rock beats scissors.
2. Scissors beat paper.
3. Paper beats rock.

The player and the computer both choose one of these options, and the outcome is determined based on the rules above.

## Technologies Used

The project is implemented using the following technologies:

- HTML: The basic structure and user interface of the game are built using HTML.
- CSS: Some minimal styling is applied using CSS to make the game visually appealing.
- JavaScript: The game logic is implemented using JavaScript to handle player choices, computer choices, and determine the winner.

## How to Play

To play the Rock Paper Scissors game, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. You will see three icons/buttons representing rock, paper, and scissors.
4. Click on the icon/button corresponding to your choice.
5. The computer will randomly select its choice.
6. The result will be displayed on the screen, indicating whether you won, lost, or the game ended in a tie.
7. Play again by clicking on the icons/buttons to make a new choice.

## Development Process

The development of this project followed these steps:

1. Set up the basic HTML structure for the game.
2. Add CSS styling to make the game visually appealing.
3. Write JavaScript functions to handle player choices, computer choices, and determine the winner.
4. Add event listeners to the icons/buttons to capture user clicks and trigger the game logic.
5. Display the results on the screen.
6. Test the game thoroughly to ensure all the rules are correctly implemented.
7. Refactor and optimize the code as necessary.

## Future Improvements

Although this implementation covers the basic functionality of Rock Paper Scissors, there are several ways to improve and expand the project, such as:

- Adding a score system to keep track of wins, losses, and ties.
- Implementing a graphical user interface (GUI) with more appealing visuals.
- Adding sound effects or animations to enhance the user experience.
- Creating additional game modes or variations, such as Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock.

Feel free to contribute to this project and explore these ideas!
